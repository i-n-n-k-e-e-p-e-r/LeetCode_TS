- Follow up: Finish Hash Table problems 49, 347, 560 in leftover days or use them as warm-ups

Notes:
- If you finish early on a topic, pick extra medium/hard problems from the same topic.
- If a problem is too hard in one sitting, attempt core sub-problems (write tests, simplify constraints) and revisit on Sat.

---

## Daily Routine (template)
- Warm-up (10–15 min): quick review of top patterns or one easy problem.
- Read & Understand (10–15 min): clarify inputs/outputs, constraints, examples.
- First attempt (25–45 min): design approach, write pseudocode or draw diagrams.
- Implement (30–60 min): code focusing on correctness.
- Test & Optimize (15–30 min): run edge cases and improve complexity if necessary.
- Post-mortem (10–20 min): write 5–8 bullet takeaways (pattern, pitfalls, complexity, variations).

Saturday (Review)
- Re-solve one or two hardest problems from the week under time pressure.
- Read editorial, compare approaches, and integrate best ideas into notes.

Sunday (Rest)
- Optional light review (skim notes, flashcards). Prioritize recovery.

---

## Weekly Metrics & Targets
Track these values after each week:
- Problems attempted
- Problems solved without editorial help
- Problems solved after reading editorial
- Average time per problem
- Top 3 weak topics (problem IDs)
- Notes pages updated

Target progression:
- Weeks 1–4: aim to independently solve ≥60% of attempted problems
- Weeks 5–8: aim for ≥80% independent solves and faster implementation

---

## Practice Tips & Good Habits
- Speak your thought process aloud (practice interviews).
- Start with the simplest viable approach; optimize only if necessary.
- When stuck, break the problem: reduce constraints, solve a smaller input, or handle a sub-problem.
- Maintain a one-page cheat sheet (patterns, two-pointer, DP states, common graph traversals).
- After each solved problem, write 1–2 example follow-ups or variants.
- Timebox practice occasionally (45–60 minute mock session) to build endurance.

---

## Mock Interviews & Final Prep
- After Week 4: schedule one 45–60 minute mock interview.
- After Week 6: schedule another mock and remediate recurring mistakes.
- Week 8: perform 2–3 timed sets (2 problems in 60–90 minutes) to simulate onsite rounds.

Possible mock formats:
- 45-minute live problem with explanation + 15-minute feedback
- Pair-programming with peer
- Platform-based mock (record/receive feedback)

---

## Extensions I can help with
If you'd like, I can:
- Convert this into a 6-week accelerated plan.
- Produce a day-by-day checklist with direct LeetCode URLs.
- Generate a printable one-page cheat sheet summarizing patterns.
- Produce starter templates (language-specific) for quick coding during practice.

Good luck. Stick to consistent practice, measure progress weekly, and focus on communication and clarity as much as on solutions.
